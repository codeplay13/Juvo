A Aid for the Visually Impaired.
The main project can be broken down in steps to understand the working.
1. (System) Detect all objects in the vision.
2. (System) Communicate the name of the objects to the user via text-to-speech (e.g. bottle, book, vase etc).
3. (User) Press a button and input the name of the object he/she (via voice) wants to reach to (eg. bottle).
4. (System) Track only the input object and also a unique color band on the user's wrist, to calculate the distance and the angle between the object and the user's hand.
5. (User) Press a button and the system will communicate the distance and the angle between the user's hand and the object repeated.
6. Repeat the 5th step until you (user) reach the object.


The repo also contains other interesting image processing codes that were usefull for the implementation of the project.
